                <div class="textbox">
                <p>I see you've chosen the red pill. So welcome to <strong>why me?</strong></p>
              <p>
                Before I get into why you want me to be on your team, let me tell you a little bit about myself. 
                <p>
                A few fun things: I write, I printmake, I read (and watch) a lot of speculative fiction, I make my own salves and tinctures, I fence (epeé), I love to solo travel and learn languages  (currently JavaScript and Spanish), and I've recently perfected my Ceasar dressing. 
                <p>
                I recently graduated from a research Master's program in the Environmental Humanities, which overlapped chronologically with my role as a learning developer for a harm reduction non-profit. 
                <p>
                That happened to me entirely on accident. I started as what they called an 'e-converter', which was, to be honest, a quite repetitive job including copy-pasting training manuals directly into LMS software. 
                <p>
                I loved the opportunity I got, but my brain doesn't do well when it's not exposed to stimulation. So I made up some work for myself. I learned some basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript- everything you're seeing here- and started building the courses from scratch instead. Before I knew it, the entire e-learning department had essentially become me.
                <p>
                I like this story a lot because I think it showcases how I channel one of my weaknesses into one of my biggest strengths: my impatience breeds creativity, hard work, and an independent development of my skills.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Non-Linear</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>I'm a deeply non-linear thinker. While sometimes, A to B to C truly is the shortest way forward, often it's something else. Something closer to A to </p> <div class="circle"></div><p>to 24. </p> 
                <p>I'm not afraid of ways of thinking that seem to be nonsensical at first. My Master's thesis was about the agency and multiple intelligences of mushrooms. That's not something you cover in a linear sense. That's something you start in Tassili-n-Ajjer in 12,000 BC and end in the modern ethnography of the nightclub.</p>
                <p>And so why is this an asset to you? Communications aren't linear. To strengthen the image and the brand, you can't talk the same content through the same form and expect results. You need different timing, angles, mediums, tones, dialects. You need to push an idea as a whole.  </p>
                <p>That holstic, encompassing approach is the true benefit of non-linearity. And it's something I have built-in.  </p>

                <h2>Resourceful</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>I don't always start with much, but I finish with everything I can. Here is an incomplete list of things I've taught myself over the past four or so years: 
                </p>
                       <p style="font-size:smaller; margin-bottom: -10px"> HTML, CSS, and enough JavaScript to scrape by</p>
                       <p style="font-size:smaller; margin-bottom: -10px">Herbalism</p>
                       <p style="font-size:smaller; margin-bottom: -10px">   Adobe Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, and Animate</p>
                       <p style="font-size:smaller; margin-bottom: -10px">Printmaking (linocut)</p>
                       <p style="font-size:smaller; margin-bottom: -10px">How to set up a back-end server and deploy a program in MS Azure</p>
                       <p style="font-size:smaller; margin-bottom: -10px">Tattooing</p>
                       <p style="font-size:smaller; margin-bottom: -10px">Data management in MongoDB</p>
                       <p style="font-size:smaller">A headstand (now working on a shoulderstand)</p>
                </p>
                <p>When the project is mine, I'll stop at nothing to finish it the way it needs to be done. I'll follow the white rabbit, and it'll lead me to the knowledge I might lack. You want me to learn best SEO practices? Google Analytics? Social media strategy? Italian? I'll do it happily. It's what I love to do the most.</p>
            </div></div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Perceptive</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>Communications is a public-facing role. And while this doesn't come from the same professional and academic experiences that are most integral to this application, it's an important thing about me: I've worked in hospitality since I was 17.</p>
                <p>You want someone to manage our presence through our online communities, and for years I've been doing this in person. I'm deeply attuned to feedback from the masses, and I know just how to respond in both the day-to-day to maintain appearances, and in crisis situations. I'm empthatic to the needs of the people (including my teammates, of course) and quick to adapt.</p>
            </div></div>
            <div class="panel">
                <h2>Generative</h2>
                <div class="textbox">
                <p>All the time I don't spend learning, I spend creating.</p>
                <p>When I built up the Harm Reduction School, not only did I simply code it into a far more sustainable and accessible existence, I also built a visual identity that wasn't part of my job description. All of the graphics, all of the interactive activities, and all of the training formats I used I documented for whoever takes over next.</p>
                <p>When I interned at the Vrije Universiteit ArtScience Gallery, I didn't just help set up the exhibition space. I created a whole catalogue of interviews with the artists, which I made in Indesign (a software I was entirely unfamiliar with). </p>
                <p>And when I work at Bending Spoons, I promise that my work will never just be the transition between the idea and its public outcome. It will generate its own momentum, harnessing the mission of the company and constructing material, both with hands and mind, that can stand on its own.</p>
