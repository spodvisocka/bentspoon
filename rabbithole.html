                <p>This is just a short documentation of the process. It's not thorough, but more of a look into my thought process. I find that it holds as a good practice. So, below, some of my notebook scribbles before/during the making of this presentation.</p>

                <p>You're more than welcome to see all the other background work I did in my GitHub repositories. I don't use it often at all, but I thought it would be fun for this project. If you've read this far, thank you! I had a wonderful day making this. It felt really nice to be challenged. And I learned how to make pixel art along the way! I hope you're alright with me having gotten carried away.</p>
